# French Baby Names Analysis

This project aims to analyze a dataset of baby names registered in France from 1900 to 2019. The dataset includes both national and departmental level data. Our goal is to create interactive visualizations that answer specific questions about the data.

## Project Objectives

    Analyze the evolution of baby names over time.
    Investigate regional effects in the popularity of baby names.
    Explore gender effects in the popularity of baby names. (Bonus)

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two parts:

### Week 1: Design Sketches

In the first week, we will sketch design alternatives for different visualizations that can help address each set of questions. We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each design. The sketches can be hand-drawn or created using software.
### Week 2: Implementation

In the second week, we will implement one of the visualizations for each of the three objectives using one of the tools from our class labs. We will provide a rationale for why we believe the chosen solution is appropriate and effective at answering the questions.
## Submission

The final submission will include:

    A link to a Git repository with our code.
    A description of why we think the chosen solution is appropriate and effective at answering these questions.

## Grading

The project will be graded based on the final implementation. The grading criteria are:

    Does the visualization convey the answer to all of these questions?
    Does the visualization clearly convey the answer to each of these questions?
    Is the visualization clear and aesthetically pleasing?
